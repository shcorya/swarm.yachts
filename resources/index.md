# Appendix

This guide would not be possible without [dockerswarm.rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks). Although that guide has been deprecated, Docker Swarm lives on as a simpler alternative to Kubernetes.

[Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/) shows users how to set up a distributed system, similar to this site. It also covers Kubernetes. Unlike swarm.yachts, Funky Penguin's guide is not suitable for WAN networks.
